# Graphite

1.19.1 Minecraft Server

# TODO

- [ ] Complete `protocol` with all 1.19.1 Minecraft packets 
- [ ] Command dispatch system
- [ ] Viewable objects (entities)
- [ ] Allow multiple players to connect (and see each other)
- [ ] Allow chunk/world modification

# Warning

Project is currently under heavy development, many things are completely non-functional

# How to run the example server

!!! Currently Graphite only supports modern versions of Linux with io_uring !!!
(An alternative network backend will be available eventually, but is not a priority)

```
$ cargo run --bin example_server
```
